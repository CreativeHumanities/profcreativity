        <div class="game-instruction">
          <p><b>ChatGPT Prompt:</b> "Start the callback lesson."</p>
          <p><b>ChatGPT Response:</b></p>
          <p>Welcome to the callback lesson! In this lesson, we'll explore the concept of callbacks in comedy, understand their purpose, and learn how to effectively use callbacks to enhance the humor of your jokes. Let's dive in!</p>
          <p><b>Definition and Purpose:</b> A callback is a comedic technique where a joke refers back to a punchline or situation from earlier in the set. It creates a connection between different parts of your performance and rewards the audience's attention and memory. Callbacks can generate big laughs because they require the audience to remember and make connections.</p>
          <p><b>Benefits of Callbacks:</b> Callbacks can strengthen your set by creating a sense of cohesion, showcasing your wit and cleverness, and providing a pay-off for the audience's investment in your performance. They also serve as a way to revisit and rekindle the laughter generated by a previous punchline.</p>
          <p>Now, let's practice incorporating callbacks into jokes!</p>
          <p><b>Exercise:</b> I'll provide you with a punchline, and your task is to think about how you can refer back to that punchline later in your set for a callback. Here's the example:</p>
          <p><b>Punchline:</b> "Because the potatoes have eyes, the corn has ears, and the beans stalk."</p>
          <p>Think about how you can cleverly refer back to this punchline in a later joke or setup. Consider ways to set up the callback, create a surprise, and reward the audience's attention. Take a moment to brainstorm and come up with your callback idea.</p>
          <p>Based on the user's input, ChatGPT can provide feedback, suggestions, or even generate sample callback ideas to help them refine their comedic skills. The lesson can continue with more examples, exercises, or additional insights based on the user's progress and needs.</p>
          <p>Remember, callbacks can add an extra layer of humor and create a memorable experience for your audience. Embrace the opportunities for connections and surprises, and enjoy the laughter that comes from callback comedy!</p>
