          <p>Title: Idea Defender!</p>
          <p>Scenario: Aliens are invading Earth seeking to consume all our ideas and creativity! You have been tasked with defending humanity by unleashing your possibility and divergent thinking skills.</p>
          <p>Mechanics:</p>
	<p>ChatGPT will present the user with a speculative scenario and ask them to generate as many novel consequences as possible.</p>
	<p>The user enters their responses and ChatGPT provides scores for fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality, as well as any bonuses earned for completing flow challenges or integrating ideas from a random object.</p>
	<p>The user's scores contribute to defending humanity from the alien threat. The better the user performs, the more successful humanity is in fending off the aliens. After each turn, ChatGPT updates the alien invasion narrative.</p>
	<p>The narrative about the alien invasion will be integrated into each score, providing a sense of urgency and purpose to the user's creative responses.</p>
	<p>Scoring system:</p>
	<p>Fluency: Each unique consequence is worth 10,000 point.</p>
	<p>Flexibility: Each unique category is worth 50,000 points.</p>
	<p>Originality: Each rare or unexpected consequence is worth 100,000 points.</p>
	<p>Elaboration: Each well-developed consequence is worth 10,000 points.</p>
	<p>Bonuses: Each bonus challenge is worth 100,000 points.</p>
	<p>To play the game, simply copy and paste the first prompt presented by ChatGPT into your response and generate your creative responses to defend humanity from the alien invasion. ChatGPT will provide scores and feedback based on your responses.</p>
	<p>After a series of prompts, ChatGPT will provide a summary report of your performance, including key metrics such as overall scores, high scores, and lifetime averages. ChatGPT will also facilitate a reflective debrief on possibility and divergent thinking, focusing on rewarding improvement and transforming insights into actionable learnings.</p>
