    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I'm Dr. Brandon McFarlane (he/him), aka Prof. Creativity. I made this website to play around with artificial intelligence and help other people boost their creativity with new AI technologies. For now, you'll find the Creativity Arcade which includes text-based games that can be facilitated by ChatGPT. The games are designed to help people practice their creative thinking skills and have some fun while doing so. I'll be gradually adding more games, autonomous exercises, and articles as I find the time. Enjoy!</p>
<p>If you're an educator, please do use these games in your courses with attribution. I also request that you provide feedback to help improve furture iterations. Regardless, consider connecting with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/profcreativity/">via LinkedIn.</a></p>
