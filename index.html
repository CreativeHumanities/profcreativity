    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I'm Dr. Brandon McFarlane (he/him), aka Prof. Creativity. I made this website to play around with artificial intelligence and help other people boost their creativity with new AI technologies. For now, you'll find the Creativity Arcade which includes text-based games that can be facilitated by ChatGPT. The games are designed to help people practice their creative thinking skills and have some fun while doing so. I'll be gradually adding more games, autonomous exercises, and articles as I find the time. Enjoy!</p>
<p>If you're an educator, please do use these games in your courses with attribution. I also request that you provide feedback to help improve furture iterations. Regardless, consider connecting with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/profcreativity/">via LinkedIn.</a></p>

			<h2>Why ChatGPT Will Actually Become a Catalyst for Innovation in Higher Education</h2>
			<p>ChatGPT will drive innovation because it facilitates inherently enjoyable experimentation and removes many motivation-sapping creativity killers. It is well established that intrinsic motivation is the most important factor when it comes to creativity and innovation. Organizations can provide creativity training (or, perhaps, strategies for writing prompts that will generate creative ideas), and they can also provide necessary supports. But, if employees (or students) lack motivation and passion, they are not going to adapt and innovate. They’ll just use the technology to complete tasks faster, resulting in the creation of well-structured but lower-quality outputs ridden with factual errors, clichés, and/or potentially hateful or insensitive content (what we now call AI hallucinations). Here's the most important strategic action leaders can take right now: think about why ChatGPT will make work more joyful.</p>

			<h2>Higher Education Leadership in the Age of AI: Harnessing ChatGPT for Transformative Change</h2>
			<p>Higher education leaders can use AI technologies as “possibility machines” to create inspiring visions for the future, which can then be leveraged to motivate teammates and secure resources. To do so, I share why I’ve been using ChatGPT to rapidly prototype new, domain-specific innovation management processes in an attempt to save the humanities. While all my examples pertain to the humanities, I conclude by sharing a prompt process that can be applied in pretty much any discipline to generate more authentic and engaging tools for innovation management in higher education. Happy reading and innovating!</p>

			<h2>Welcome to the Metacognitive Economy!</h2>
<p>Current AI technologies are inspired by and attempt to replicate human cognition. Regardless if you're engineering AI technology or using it to create wonderfully new things, you're going to be doing an awful lot of metacognitive work. This article shares a little creative experiment I did with ChatGPT-4 based upon the popular “Pizza Challenge” in my creativity and innovation courses to demonstrate why you need to start thinking about thinking right now.</p>

			<h2>Watch Out for These Creativity Killing Supervillains</h2>
			<p>Fellow creatives: I researched Teresa Amabile's "How to Kill Creativity" and made a dossier outlining the evil misdeeds for three creativity-crushing supervillains. I suspect many of you may have encountered these fiends, though in slightly different manifestations. Regardless if you're a CEO or just starting your career, you must remain diligent and mitigate the risk of these supervillains sabotaging your organization's culture and capacity for innovation. Share this pertinent research anyone you know who values creativity.</p>

			<h2>Creativity Collider: How to Generate Novel Ideas with ChatGPT</h2>
			<p>In this article, I’ll share a fun and effective strategy that will enable you to overcome AI’s perceived limitations, turning ChatGPT into a creativity collider capable of generating novel, original ideas by smashing seemingly unrelated concepts. So, put on your lab coat and safety goggles, and get ready to experiment with unexpected collisions that might just change the way you think about AI and creativity.</p>
