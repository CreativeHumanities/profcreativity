    	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<section class="lesson">
	<h2>Creative Fun with AI!</h2>
	<p>I'm Dr. Brandon McFarlane (he/him), aka Prof. Creativity. I made this website to play around with artificial intelligence and help 	others boost their creativity with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
	<p>I conceptualized ChatGPT as a gaming console and prompts as video game catridges. I wondered: could I make games or interactive 	lessons that anyone could play with ChatGPT to practice and foster their creativity skills?</p>
	<p>The result: profcreativity.com which includes Creativity Arcade, Creativity 101, and Comedy 101.

	<section class="lesson">
	<h2>Creativity Arcade: Gamifying Creativity Training</h2>
		<p><a href="#arcade">The Creativity Arcade</a> features interactive games inspired by standard creativity tests and improv games. I originally designed these games for my students in my creativity and innovation courses as at Sheridan College. But, now, anyone can boost their creativity through deliberate practice and also have some fun while doing so!</p>
	</section>
	<section class="lesson">
	<h2>Creativity101: Your AI Creativity Professor</h2>
		<p>Artificial intelligence presents unprecedeneted opportunities for learning. I design and instruct wildly popular post-secondary courses on creativity and innovation. I challenged myself to make interactive lessons faciliated by AI that could introduce anyone to basic concepts. <a href="#creativity101">Creativity 101</a> introduces you to the key findings of the scholarly study of creativity and how to apply them to turbo-charge your creativity. For this pilot, I applied my expertise to rapidly prototype autonomuous lectures faciliated by ChatGPT.</p>
</section>
	<section class="lesson">
	<h2>Comedy 101: Your AI Comedy Professor?</h2>
	<p>I know a lot about creativity but when it comes to comedy, not so much. I'm amateur who has written and produced comedy shorts that have won awards at film festivals, but I've never rigorously studied or taught comedy. I created <a href="#comedy101">Comedy 101</a> to find out how amateurs, like myself, might use artificial intelligence for self-directed learning.</p>
